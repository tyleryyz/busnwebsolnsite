				<h1><strong>
					Project Description:
				</strong></h1>
			<p>We are Business-Web Solutions, and our sponsor is Robert Lokken,
				owner of <a href="https://www.tailoredtutoringco.com/">Tailored
					Tutoring Co.</a>, an online professional tutoring company based
					here in Flagstaff, AZ.

            What sets Robert and Tailored Tutoring Co. apart from
						other web-based tutoring sites, is the ability for students to take
						a picture of a problem, upload it to a tutor, and receive a
						personalized video solution from that tutor.  While this feature
						provides a lot of value to students, it is currently a manual process
						for our sponsor to complete himself. This process is just too
						cumbersome to be sustainable long-term without automation.

            <h2><strong>The problem:</strong></h2>  Currently, the
						<a href =https://www.tailoredtutoringco.com/>website</a>
						is poorly optimized for mobile. Students often find themselves
						having to take a picture of a problem on a phone, email it to
						themselves, and then upload it to the Tailored Tutoring website
						via a computer. Clearly a time consuming process for the student.
						On Tailored Tutoring’s end, the problem is even worse.
						Robert gets a notification that a student problem
						has been submitted, then manually has to go through the submission to
						see what it is about, and search for a qualified tutor in the subject
						area that is currently available.  He notifies the tutor who
						then creates a video, uploads it to a Google Drive, and then Robert has
						to create a personal link to the solution video, and email that to
						the student, notifying them that their problem has been solved and
						is viewable. This is obviously a less than ideal process, and could
						do with some automation and fine-tuning.

            <h3><strong>Our solution:</strong></h3> As the business scales, this whole
						process is becoming too much work for our sponsor, and needs to be automated.
						That is where we come in.  Our goals here are to completely
						automate the submission process and improve the site by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Building with mobile in mind by using ReactJS
											and Bulma which utilize a mobile-first design philosophy.</li>
                    <li>Automating the problem-submission process by building
											a new web portal.  Users and tutors will have profiles,
											with problems submitted under subjects and automatically
											sent out to corresponding, available tutors in those subject areas.</li>
                    <li>Incorporating a database to store these personalized tutor-videos for
											students using MongoDB. From there, students will be able
											to access their videos for a specified time; while Robert
											will be able to download to a hard drive and have a
											physical backup of all videos made.</li>
                </ul>
            In conclusion, we are here to help automate Robert and Tailored
						Tutoring Co.’s business, specifically focusing on their unique
						feature: the problem-submission process.  We will emphasize automation,
						mobile-friendly design, and a web portal with user profiles to help
						Tailored Tutoring Co. scale their business into the future. </p>
